# Bible App

A new Flutter project. This project is the starting framework for which we will build our Bible app.

# How to use this git repository

All git projects have a main branch "master" and several other branches where you can work on the app locally. Please remember to *always* save projects in your own local branch and ask to push to the master branch.
